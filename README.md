# 42_push_swap

There’s only a few moves you’re allowed to used to manipulate the stacks that we’re going to called “Actions”. The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible.

So what actions are we allowed to use on the two stacks?
```
The actions are named: sa, sb, ss, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr, pa, pb.
```
## Here’s how they all work:
